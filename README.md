## Acknowledgements

Thanks to the famous Milwaukee frozen custard stands for the app's inspiration. My hometown came through to help me learn!

Thanks to Google and Udacity for the opportunity to learn so much in so little time. I want to learn and code so much more!

A huge "thank you" to Heather. As a social media authority, she is an excellent resource for me to get ideas and feedback on my apps!
